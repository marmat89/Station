/**
 * 
 * A hygrometer is an instrument used for measuring the moisture content in the
 * atmosphere. Humidity measurement instruments usually rely on measurements of
 * some other quantity such as temperature, pressure, mass or a mechanical or
 * electrical change in a substance as moisture is absorbed. By calibration and
 * calculation, these measured quantities can lead to a measurement of humidity.
 * Modern electronic devices use temperature of condensation (the dew point), or
 * changes in electrical capacitance or resistance to measure humidity
 * differences. The first practical hygrometer was invented by polymath Johann
 * Heinrich Lambert in 1755.
 * 
 * The DHT11 is chosen because it is lab calibrated, accurate and stable and its
 * signal output is digital. Most important of all, it is relatively inexpensive
 * for the given performance. The DHT11 is a relatively cheap sensor for
 * measuring temperature and humidity. The DHT22 is similar to the DHT11 and has
 * greater accuracy. However, this library is not suitable for the DHT21 or
 * DHT22 as they have a different data format. Check DHTlib for support of these
 * sensors. This library is tested on a MEGA2560 and is confirmed working on an
 * Arduino 2009. Niesteszeck has made an interrupt-driven library for the DHT11
 * sensor. Andy Dalton has made a modified version. Difference is that the
 * DATAPIN is defined in the constructor, resulting in one dedicated object per
 * sensor. The DHT11 has three lines: GND, +5V and a single data line. By means
 * of a handshake, the values are clocked out over the single digital line.
