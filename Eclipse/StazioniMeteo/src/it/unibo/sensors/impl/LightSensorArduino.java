/**
 * LDR GL5528 is photoresistor much diffuse for arduino
 * A photoresistor or light-dependent resistor (LDR) or photocell is a
 * light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor
 * decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it
 * exhibits photoconductivity. A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive
 * detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits.
 * 
 * A photoresistor is made of a high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a
 * photoresistor can have a resistance as high as a few megaohms (MÎ©), while in
 * the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred
 * ohms. If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency,
 * photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to
 * jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole
 * partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance
 * range and sensitivity of a photoresistor can substantially differ among
 * dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photoresistors may react substantially
 * differently to photons within certain wavelength bands
